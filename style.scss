This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

Resetting and rebuilding styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Eric Meyer http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html
along with Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/

All sizing (typography, layout, padding/margins etc) are inspired by a modular scale that uses 12px/14px as base sizes with a 1.618 ratio.
We use the excellent modular scale tool built by Tim Brown to calculate this. http://modularscale.com/scale/?px1=14&px2=12&ra1=1.618&ra2=0
